# MACNTStego: A Software Package for Adaptive Fuzzy Logic-Driven Image Steganography in the Spatial Domain

## Introduction

**MACNTStego** integrates fuzzy logic to embed secret payloads into digital images with enhanced imperceptibility. The evaluating process includes multiple embedding strategies such as fuzzy-based, non-fuzzy, and extractable variants.

## Features

- **Fuzzy logic-based adaptive embedding** ensuring visual quality and minimizing distortion.
- **Lossless steganography** ensuring full reversibility.
- **PSNR and MSE evaluation** for comparison between methods.
- **Modular MATLAB functions** ensuring easy integration and experimentation.
  
## Installation

To run **MACNTStego**, ensure you follow the following steps:

- **Open MATLAB Environment**
- **Clone the Repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/FuzzyStego.git
cd FuzzyStego
```
- **Run the Main Script:**
```
